# Idea 4

## The need, the user, and you
**This section describes whom the project would serve and why you're interested
in the project.**

### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? How would their experience improve if you could help 
them?_


### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_


### Domain
_Describe the project's domain in five words._

## The language
**This section helps you argue that a DSL can serve the need(s) described in
the previous section.**

### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_


### Linguistic pieces
**For each question below, brainstorm a few answers. If a question does not
apply to your project, explain why.**

_What are some likely nouns in this domain? (Nouns correspond to kinds of
data. In our image manipulation DSL, an **image** is a noun.)_


_What are some likely adjectives? (Adjectives correspond to values for a
particular kind of data; for example: a **JPEG** image.)_ 



_What are some likely verbs? (Verbs correspond to behaviors or actions; for
example: **rotating**.)_


_What are some likely adverbs? (Verbs correspond to modifications to a specific
behavior or action; for example: rotating **left**.)_


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well
do they address the need? What do you like about the language? Are there parts
of the language you think could be improved?_


## The Project
**This section examines whether the idea makes for a good project for this
course.**

### Suitability
_If someone were to work on this project, what percentage of their time would be
spent directly engaging in the **language** aspects of this project (e.g.,
making language-design decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the
project (e.g., implementing a complicated visualization that doesn't require a
lot of language design)?_

### Scope
_How ambitious is this project for you? Not very? Somewhat? Very?_

### Benefits and drawbacks
_Why might this be a good idea for a project?_ 


_Why might this not be a good idea project?_
